    AppleCare+ is Apple's brand name for extended warranty and technical support plans for their devices. AppleCare+ extends the devices' one-year limited warranty and the ninety days of technical support (which is known as basic AppleCare). It allows the customer unlimited incidents of accidental damage with a deductible (which, like the price of the plan, varies by device).[1] AppleCare+ is available for many Apple products, including Mac computers and displays, Beats headphones, HomePods, iPhones and iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs.[2] AppleCare+ plans include Apple software associated with the covered hardware. <br><br> </p>

    Every Apple Display, Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPad, iPod, iPhone, HomePod, Mac, and AirPods comes with complimentary telephone technical support and a limited warranty from Apple. AppleCare extends the service coverage by two or three years (depending on the device) from the purchase date, and provides one-stop service and support from Apple experts.[3] Customers can elect to continue their AppleCare coverage on a monthly basis upon the expiration of their initial plan. <br><br>

    AppleCare is sold by Apple and its authorized resellers. It can be attached, via the serial number, to devices at the time of purchase, or up to thirty or sixty days (depending on location) post-purchase. <br><br>
    
    For all hardware devices, following the included ninety-day telephone and online support, and one-year hardware warranty, buying AppleCare for a MacBook computer or Apple displays extends both support and hardware to three years. Additionally, buying AppleCare for iPods and other iOS devices can extend both support and hardware to two years. <br><br>
    
    AppleCare also includes an express replacement service for iPad and iPhone. AppleCare insures against accidental damage, unlike the statutory warranty.<br><br> </p>

            Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[8][11] The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[12] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[13]: 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[14] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer.[15] It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[16][17]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[18] <br><br>

            Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated in Cupertino, California,[1] on January 3, 1977,[19][20] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[21] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[22] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to US$118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[23] <br><br>
            
            The Apple II, also designed by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[24] It differs from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, which were superseded by the 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[25][26] <br>
